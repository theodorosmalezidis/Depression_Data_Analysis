 Majority without history: The largest group consists of individuals with neither a personal history of mental illness nor a family history of depression, accounting for over 210,000 individuals.
Mental illness more common: Individuals with a personal history of mental illness but no family history of depression form the second-largest group (around 91,000), indicating that mental illness may occur independently of family history for many.
Family depression correlation: The group with both a personal history of mental illness and a family history of depression (34,244) suggests that while family history may increase risk, not all individuals with mental illness have a family history.
This analysis can be used to further investigate possible genetic or environmental influences. â€‹
